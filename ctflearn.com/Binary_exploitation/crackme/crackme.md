How did I capture the flag?

1. We get a 32-bit **PE** Windows executable from the above link. 

2. I am actually running a Linux machine, so I thought it would not be possible to solve this question without windows. But as usual, I dumped all the strings in **crackme.exe** into **cm.strings** and had a look. 

		$ file crackme.exe
		crackme.exe: PE32 executable (console) Intel 80386, for MS Windows	
		$ 
		$ strings crackme.exe > cm.strings

3.  The flag was right there in the strings file. 

		%Pq@
		%@q@
		%Lq@
		%Dq@
		%0q@
		%Hq@
		%4q@
		%,q@
		%<q@
		%Tq@
		% q@
		%(q@
		%8q@
		flag{h4ck3rm3n_4ss3mbl3}
