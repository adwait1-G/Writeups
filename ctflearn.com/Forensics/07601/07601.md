### Problem: 07601

Question: 
> https://mega.nz/#!oFUx2STJ!6eLJSXvAfGnemqWpNbLQtOHBvtkCzA7-zycVjhHPYQQ I think I lost my flag in there. Hopefully, it won't get attacked...

How did I capture the flag?

1. We get an image named **AGT.png**  . I opened it in **vi** and the first thing I noticed is that it is not a **png** file. It is a **jpg** file.
			
		ÿØÿà^@^PJFIF^@^

* **JFIF** stands for **JPEG File Interchange Format** . 

2. I used the **strings** command and dumped all the strings it has into **AGT.strings** .  

		$ strings AGT.png > AGT.strings
		
3. As I glanced through AGT.strings, this is what I found. 
		
		jiKs
		(oN6
		Secret Stuff.../UX
		Secret Stuff.../.DS_StoreUX
		Eh`Cz

		__MACOSX/Secret Stuff.../Don't Open This.../UX
		__MACOSX/Secret Stuff.../Don't Open This.../._.DS_StoreUX
		cg`b`
		Secret Stuff.../Don't Open This.../I Warned You.jpegUX

* Looking at this, I came to a conclusion that it is not a normal JFIF image. It could have hidden ZIP files in it. 

3. I used **binwalk** to inspect AGT.png . This is what I got. 

		$ binwalk AGT.png

		$ 

* Bingo! . There are 3 ZIP files inside it. 

4. **binwalk** is an amazing tool. We can extracts these ZIP files easily. 

		$ binwalk -e AGT.png

* You would get a directory **_AGT.png.extracted** . Navigate into it. 

5.  You would have this. 

		$ ls
		25118.zip  2570.zip  47CA2.zip  __MACOSX  Secret Stuff...

6. Obviously, let us get into the directory **Secret Stuff...** . 

		$ ls
		Don't Open This...
		$ 
* Into **Don't Open This...** . 
		
		$ ls
		I Warned You.jpeg
		$ 

* Check out the image. It is a blank image. 
* Let us dump the strings in it into strings.txt . 
* As I went in search for the flag, I found this.

* We have a flag-like string. **ABCTF{Du$t1nS_D0jo}1r** . I submitted it and it got accepted. 

### Flag: ABCTF{Du$t1nS_D0jo}1r

---------------------------------------

PS: 

1. There are 3 zip files. You may unzip them. They are copies of **__MACOSX** and **Secret Stuff...** .
